alu ops:
OOOO iDDD AAA bbbbb

    d addressing mode
     0DDD           - register direct
     1DDD           - register indirect
     0000           - dest is r0, throw away result
     1000           - program counter [r0]
    b addressing mode
              0XXXX - immediate (4 bit signed)
              10000 - immediate is next instruction word (r0) (16 bit signed)
              10BBB - register direct
              11000 - program counter [r0] (pc reads as +2 current instruction)
              11BBB - register indirect

branch ops:
10 CCCC oooooooooo  - b  - (un)conditional branch

         10 bit signed offset (-511/512)

pseudo instructions:
    mov d, b    - add d, r0, b
    neg d, b    - sub d, r0, b
    not d, a    - xor d, a, #-1
    teq a, b    - xor r0, a, b
    tst a, b    - and r0, a, b
    cmp a, b    - sub r0, a, b
    cmn a, b    - add r0, a, b

special cases:
    branch to register, use [r0] as target
        mov [r0], lr - branch to lr

    branch to fixed 16bit address
        b #imm - mov [r0], #imm

    indirect branch to register
        b reg  - mov [r0], reg

    double indirect branch to register
        b reg  - mov [r0], [reg]

    access pc (pc reads as +2) use [r0] as source
        mov lr, pc - mov r7, [r0]

conditions (ARM style):
